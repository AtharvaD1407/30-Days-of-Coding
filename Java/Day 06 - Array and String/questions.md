## Practice Questions

### 1D Array Questions

1. Write a program to initialize a 1D array of 10 integers and find the sum of all the even numbers in the array.
2. Given an array arr = {5, 8, 12, 15, 7}, write a program that finds the largest and smallest numbers without using built-in methods.
3. Write a program to reverse a 1D array in-place without using another array.
4. Given an array arr = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, write a method to rotate the array to the right by k positions.
5. Write a method that removes all occurrences of a given element from an array and returns the updated array.

### 2D Array Questions

1. Write a program to check if a given 2D array is symmetric (i.e., it is equal to its transpose).
2. Given a 3x3 matrix, write code to find the sum of each column in the matrix.
3. Write a program that finds the row with the smallest sum in a 2D array.
4. Write a method that adds a constant value to each element in a given 2D array.
5. Write a program to check if two matrices are identical (same size and elements).

### String Questions

1. Write a program to check if a string is a valid number (i.e., it can be converted to an integer or float).
2. Write a method to count the number of words in a string.
3. Given a string str = "Java Programming", write code to find and print the position of the first space character.
4. Write a program that finds the longest substring without repeating characters in a string.
