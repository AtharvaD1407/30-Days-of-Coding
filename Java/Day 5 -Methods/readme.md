## ðŸš€ Overview

Methods in Java are **blocks of code** that perform specific tasks. They help in:

- **Code reusability** (Avoid repeating code)
- **Modular programming** (Break code into smaller, manageable units)
- **Better debugging and maintenance**

This file, **Methods.java**, covers everything related to **methods in Java**, including:

- Defining and calling methods
- Method parameters and return types
- Method overloading

## ðŸ”¹ What are Methods?

A method in Java is a block of code that performs a specific task and is executed when it is called.

### ðŸ’¡ Basic Syntax

    // Code block
    return value; // (if returnType is not void)
}
```

## ðŸ”¹ Types of Methods in Java

1. Methods without Parameters and Return Type
2. Methods with Parameters
3. Methods with Return Type
4. Methods with Multiple Parameters
5. Method Overloading
6. Methods with varargs (Variable Arguments)

## ðŸ”¹ Summary

âœ” Methods help organize and reuse code efficiently. <br>
âœ” Methods can have parameters and return values. <br>
âœ” Method Overloading allows the same method name with different parameters. <br>
âœ” Varargs (...) allows methods to accept multiple arguments dynamically. <br>
