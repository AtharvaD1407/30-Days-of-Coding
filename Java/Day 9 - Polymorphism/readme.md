## 📌 **Overview**

Dynamic Method Dispatch (also known as runtime polymorphism) is an advanced concept in Java that allows method calls to be determined at runtime rather than at compile-time. This enables flexibility and dynamic behavior in object-oriented programming.

## 📝 **What We Have Covered So Far**

Before diving deep into Dynamic Method Dispatch, we have already covered:

- ✅ Method Overloading (Compile-time polymorphism) – Covered in [Day 7 - OOPs](../Day%207%20-%20OOPs/OOP_Basics.java)
- ✅ Method Overriding (Runtime polymorphism) – Covered in [Day 8 - Inheritance](../Day%208%20-%20Inheritance/Inheritance.java)

Now, we will extend our understanding by exploring how Java resolves method calls dynamically at runtime! 🔥

## 🔍 **Understanding Dynamic Method Dispatch**

1️⃣ Base class reference can refer to a subclass object.
2️⃣ The method call is resolved at runtime, not at compile-time.
3️⃣ Java uses method overriding to achieve dynamic behavior.

## **Conclusion**

Dynamic Method Dispatch is a key concept in runtime polymorphism that allows Java to determine which method to invoke at runtime based on the actual object reference. It enables flexibility, extensibility, and maintainability in object-oriented programming by allowing method calls to be resolved dynamically rather than at compile-time. 🚀
