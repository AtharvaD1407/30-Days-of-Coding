## Practice Questions:

1. **Create a `move()` method in the `Animal` class** and override it in `Dog`, `Cat`, and `Bird`.
2. **Add a `feed()` method** in the `Animal` class and override it in `Dog`, `Cat`, and `Bird`.
3. **Add a field `age`** in the `Animal` class and update constructors in subclasses to handle it.
4. **Add a method `displayInfo()`** in the `Animal` class to print the name and age of an animal.
5. **Create a `compareAge()` method** that compares the age of two `Animal` objects.
6. **Implement a `countLegs()` method** that returns the number of legs for each animal (e.g., 4 for `Dog`, 2 for `Bird`).
7. **Add a `color` field** in `Animal` and update the subclasses to use this field.
8. **Create a `toString()` method** in `Animal` that returns the name and type of animal.
9. **Modify the `Bird` class** to implement an additional method `fly()`.
10. **Modify the `Dog` class** to implement a method `bark()` and call it from the `main()` method.

---

1. **Modify the `Animal` class** to include a `species` field and update the subclasses to initialize it.
2. **Change the `Animal` class constructor** to be private and create a static factory method for object creation.
3. **Change the `makeSound()` method** in `Animal` to be abstract and implement it in all subclasses.
4. **Add a `huntingBehavior()` method** in `Animal` and override it in subclasses where applicable (e.g., `Cat` and `Dog`).
5. **Replace the `super()` call** in the subclass constructors with a different constructor of the superclass. How does this affect object creation?
