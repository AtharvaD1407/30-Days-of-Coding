## Practice Questions

1. Write a Java program to declare variables for:

- Your name (String).
- Your age (int).
- Your weight (float).
- Whether you are a student (boolean).
  Print all these values.

2. Write a program that takes a temperature in Celsius (double) and converts it to Fahrenheit using the formula:
   `Fahrenheit = (Celsius Ã— 9/5) + 32`

3. Write a program to swap the values of two variables (with and without using a third variable).

4. Create a program that:

- Converts an `int` to a `double` (implicit casting).
- Converts a `double` to an `int` (explicit casting).
- Prints the results.

## Questions for you:

1. How is a String different from an array of characters (char[])? Internally, what makes String special in Java?

2. Why does Java allow implicit casting for int to double but require explicit casting for double to int?

3. Why do we need float and double when both represent decimal numbers? When should you use one over the other?
