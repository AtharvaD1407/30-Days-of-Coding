## 📌 Overview

This file covers **conditional statements** in Java, which help control the flow of a program based on different conditions.

### 💡 Topics Covered:

- **`if` Statement** → Executes a block of code only if a condition is true.
- **`if-else` Statement** → Provides an alternative action if the condition is false.
- **`if-else if-else` Statement** → Allows checking multiple conditions in sequence.
- **Nested `if` Statements** → Using an `if` inside another `if` for complex decision-making.
- **`switch-case` Statement** → Efficiently handles multiple fixed values instead of multiple `if` checks.

## 📂 Java File: `Conditionals.java`

This file contains **several examples** demonstrating different types of conditional statements:

### 🔹 **1. Basic `if` Statement**

- Checks a condition and executes the block if it's `true`.

### 🔹 **2. `if-else` Statement**

- Runs one block if the condition is `true`, otherwise executes another block.

### 🔹 **3. `if-else if-else` Statement**

- Checks multiple conditions sequentially and executes the first matching block.

### 🔹 **4. Nested `if` Statements**

- Uses an `if` statement inside another `if` for more precise decision-making.

### 🔹 **5. `switch-case` Statement**

- A structured alternative to multiple `if-else if` conditions, handling fixed values efficiently.
