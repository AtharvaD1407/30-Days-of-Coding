## 📖 Overview

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that organizes code into **objects**, which represent real-world entities. It allows for **modular, reusable, and scalable** code by using **classes and objects**.

### 🔹 **Topics Covered**

- Introduction to **Classes and Objects**
- Understanding **Constructors**
- Exploring **Instance Variables and Methods**
- Method Overloading
- Data Hiding
- Static Methods & Variables
- Final Keyword in Java

## 🏗 **1. Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**

OOP focuses on creating objects that contain both **data (attributes)** and **behaviors (methods)**. It helps in structuring code more efficiently compared to procedural programming.

### **Why Use OOP?**

✔ **Improves Code Reusability** – Code can be reused in different programs.  
✔ **Enhances Code Organization** – Large programs are easier to manage.  
✔ **Data Protection for Security** – Data can be protected from unauthorized access.  
✔ **Better Scalability** – Ideal for large applications and teams.

## 🔄 **2. Understanding Classes and Objects**

A **class** is a blueprint that defines the structure of an object, while an **object** is an instance of a class.

### **Key Concepts**

- **Class:** Defines variables and methods.
- **Object:** Created from a class and represents an entity.
- **Instance Variables:** Variables unique to each object.
- **Methods:** Define behaviors or actions for an object.

Objects **store data and execute operations**, making them useful for representing real-world entities like a "Car" or "Student."

---

## 🔧 **3. Constructors in Java**

A **constructor** is a special method used to initialize objects when they are created.

### **Types of Constructors**

1. **Default Constructor** – Automatically provided if no constructor is defined.
2. **Parameterized Constructor** – Allows passing values during object creation.
3. **Constructor Overloading** – Multiple constructors with different parameters.

### **Purpose of Constructors**

✔ Automatically initializes an object when created.  
✔ Improves code readability and reduces redundant code.  
✔ Helps set up an object’s state at the time of creation.

## 📌 **4. Instance Variables and Methods**

### **Instance Variables**

- These are attributes specific to each object of a class.
- They store the state of an object.
- Each object has its own copy of instance variables.

### **Instance Methods**

- Define the behavior of objects.
- Can access and modify instance variables.
- Called using an object of the class.

Methods can be categorized into:

- **Getter Methods:** Return values of instance variables.
- **Setter Methods:** Modify values of instance variables.
- **Utility Methods:** Perform specific operations related to the object.

---

## 🔄 **5. Method Overloading**

Method overloading allows multiple methods in the same class to have the **same name but different parameters**.

### **Benefits of Method Overloading**

✔ Makes code more readable and structured.  
✔ Reduces the number of unique method names needed.  
✔ Enhances code reusability.

Common examples include **mathematical operations, string manipulation, and input handling.**

---

## 🔒 **6. Data Hiding**

Encapsulation is the **principle of restricting direct access to object data** by making instance variables **private** and providing **public methods** (getters & setters) to access or modify them.

### **Why data hiding?**

✔ **Protects sensitive data** from accidental modification.  
✔ **Enhances code maintainability** by controlling access to variables.  
✔ **Ensures data integrity** by enforcing controlled updates.

Data hiding is commonly used in **banking systems, employee records, and secure applications.**

---

## ⚙ **7. Static Methods and Variables**

A `static` keyword is used to define methods or variables that **belong to the class itself rather than any specific object**.

### **Key Features**

- **Static Variables:** Shared across all objects of a class.
- **Static Methods:** Can be called without creating an object.
- **Common Uses:** Utility functions, counters, and configuration settings.

### **Why Use Static Methods and Variables?**

✔ Saves memory by sharing a single copy among all objects.  
✔ Useful for common operations like mathematical calculations.  
✔ Eliminates the need for unnecessary object creation.

---

## 🔥 **8. The Final Keyword in Java**

The `final` keyword is used to **restrict modification** of variables, methods, and classes.

### **Types of Final Usage**

1️⃣ **Final Variables** – Values cannot be changed once assigned.  
2️⃣ **Final Methods** – Cannot be overridden by subclasses.  
3️⃣ **Final Classes** – Cannot be extended/inherited.

This is useful for defining **constants, security-sensitive classes, and immutable methods.**
