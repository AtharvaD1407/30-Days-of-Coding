# 30-Days-of-Coding

Welcome to the **30-Days-of-Coding** repository! ðŸŽ‰

This repository is designed to provide a structured path to mastering programming languages in just 30 days. Each language folder contains coding challenges, projects, and practice questions that take you from **beginner** to **advanced** level, one day at a time. Whether you're just starting out or looking to brush up on your skills, this repository is for you. Letâ€™s get coding! ðŸš€

## Folder Structure

The repository is organized by programming languages. Each language folder contains subfolders for each day.

Hereâ€™s the current structure:

```
30-Days-of-Coding/
|
â”œâ”€â”€ Python/
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ Day 1/
â”‚ â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ syntax file
â”‚ â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ questions
â”‚ â”‚ â””â”€â”€ readme.md
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ Day 2/
â”‚ â””â”€â”€ Day 3/
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ Java/
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ Day 1/
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ ...

â”œâ”€â”€ C++/
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ Day 1/
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ ...
â”‚
â””â”€â”€ More languages coming soon...
```

Each folder includes:

- **README.md**: Provides an overview and instructions for the language.
- **Daily Challenge Files**: Code files for each day's challenge (e.g., `basicSyntax.py`, `basicSyntax.java`).
- **Practice Questions**: Extra exercises for hands-on learning.
